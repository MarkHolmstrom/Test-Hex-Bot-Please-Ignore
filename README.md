TODO:
a lot

COMPLETED:

* Barebones test suite, will add argument parsing and better efficiency later. Run `python3 test_suit.py` in `central_program` directory of UAIS repo.
* Rewrite dfs for speed (visited set monotonically increases)
* Fixing constants to current values, benefits for data type foreknowledge and faster computation (e.g. multiply by -1 to flip colors)
* Add swap rule
* Use numpy
